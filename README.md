# NetForecast-Weather-Website
The NetForecast Weather Website is a web-based application that gets you the weather information

This project is a simple application of the basic concepts we studied in our course syllabus and implementation to put the knowledge to actual purpose. 

It is mainly a focus on UI and front-end design of web applications as well as an implementation of Application Programming Interface (APIs) and de-structuring and use of the response values produced in a visually simpler and decent way to be of use to people using it.
